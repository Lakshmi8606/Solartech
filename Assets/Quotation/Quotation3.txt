On-grid or grid-tie solar systems are by far the most common and widely used by homesand businesses. These systems areconnected to the public electricity grid and do notrequire battery storage. Any solar power that you generate from an on-grid system(which is not used directly in your home) is exported onto the electricity grid and youusually get paid a feed-in-tariff (Fit) for the energy you export.Grid-tie solar systems are not able to function or generate electricity during a blackoutor power outage due to safety reasons; since blackouts usually occur when the electricitygrid is damaged. If the solar inverter was still feeding electricity into a damaged grid itwould risk the safety of the people repairing the fault/s in the network.
